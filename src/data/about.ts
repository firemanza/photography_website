  bio: [
    "Based in Johannesburg, South Africa, I'm a photographer with a deep passion for wildlife, animals, and the raw energy of motorsport. My camera is my way of connecting with the world — whether I'm tracking a leopard through the bush or capturing split-second moments on the race track.",
    "With a background in software development, I bring a technical precision to my creative work. I understand light, composition, and timing not just instinctively, but analytically — and that combination produces images that are both emotionally resonant and technically sharp.",
    "I'm currently building my photography business while pursuing creative freedom. Every shoot is an opportunity to tell a story, and I'm passionate about working with clients who value authentic, powerful imagery over generic stock-style photos.",
